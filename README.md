# üí´ About Me:
As an up-and-coming developer and detail-oriented problem-solver, I bring a new perspective to leveraging current technology to offer unique and cost-effective solutions. I'm currently pursuing a B.S in Computer Science with a solid grasp of various programming languages and frameworks. I'm proficient in Java, Python, C, JavaScript, and more. <br><br>From driving Web & Data development initiatives at George Mason University to conducting research for the Air Force through the C5I Center, I excel in highly adaptive and fast-paced environments. <br><br>Whether it's spearheading the development of InspireHealth, a fundraising platform for global hospitals, or contributing to the creation of a custom blockchain implementation, I'm all about visible and tangible results. Notably, our team won 2nd place with InspireHealth at HooHacks 2024 for the health track. I enjoy participating in Hackathons and spontaneously meeting new people to work on an impactful project with. I'm part of the Tech4Good Club and the Philosophy club at George Mason University. <br>
